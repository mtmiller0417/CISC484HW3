REPORT for CISC 484 HW3

Concerning the realationship between k and the size of the new image:
    Lower values of k are associated with smaller file sizes. As the k's 
    increase, so does the file's size. This only holds up to a certain k.  
    Eventually, around k = 5 for the 3 pictures, increasing k does not increase 
    the file size, and so the file size remains approximately the same for larger 
    k's.

Best k for picture 1:
    I think the best k for picture 1 is 20 because all k's less than this 
    don't caputre enough complexity of the picture, and k = 20 is around the 
    same size as k = 10 and k = 5.

Best k for picture 2:
    I think that k = 20 is the best k for picture 2 because it captures the 
    most detail and has a very similar file size to k = 10 and k = 5 which
    both provide less detail than k = 20.

Best k for picture 3:
    I think that the best k for picture 3 is 20 because it is very close to the
    actual image and has a very similar file size to k = 5 and k = 10, which both
    provide less detail than k = 20.

Reflection on k choices for pictures:
    I think that becasue the 3 pictures were of outside and captured a variety of 
    things, higher values of k were required to make the picture clear and distinguish
    details.
